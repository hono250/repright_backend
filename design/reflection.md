# Project Reflection

Overall, this project was enjoyable, and a big part of that came from designing something personal to me; fitness and strength training! I'm someone who goes to the gym regularly and tracks workouts manually and I'm especially excited to see how this app could help me progress and track my progress. I'm also excited to continue to further iterate on the app after this. 

**What went well? What was challenging? Mistakes?**

- Concept architecture held up really well: With well designed concepts there was no need to change anything on them throughout the rest of the development. 
  
- The way the project was built starting with problem framing up until putting everything together helped with incremental development and gave a nice structure. 

- The ExerciseLibrary and WorkoutTemplate concepts were very useful in putting the user journey together, but I wish i could have added them at the start to get feedback on them as well. 
  
**Skills**

Some skills I aquired include

-  Vue.js fundamentals (reactivity, routing, component composition)
-  backend syncs with flow-based action matching
-  LLM integration with validation strategies
-  Deployment (Render, Docker)
-  Frontend debugging strategies: Browser DevTools (network, elements, console), state tracing, systematic isolation.
-  Security thinking (what needs protection, what's safe to expose)

Some skills I still need:
- Frontend testing (no Vue Test Library experience)


**Context tool/llm usage** 

I used Claude (Anthropic) throught the assignments and an important skill when it comes to llm usage is knowing what context to give to an llm for a certain task. Another important one is making decisions on which tasks to complete yourself and which one you can use llm help on.

It was most Valuable for learning new frameworks that weren't familiar, and it was generally great at executing clear specifications, poor at forming specifications.
